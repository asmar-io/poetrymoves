      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>Will these Terms ever change?</p>
      We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with
      our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will
      place a notice on our site located at arden.cc, send you an email, and/or notify you by some
      other means. If you don&apos;t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
      unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the
      Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of

      <br />
      <strong>Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
      <br />
      The Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service
      providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable
      information online from children who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or
      solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age; if you are a
      child under 13 years of age, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the
      Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal
      information from a child under 13 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as
      possible. If you believe that a child under 13 years of age may have provided us personal
      information, please contact us at <strong>support@arden.cc.</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>What are the basics of using Arden?</p>
      You will be required to sign up for an account, select a password and user name (“Arden User
      ID”), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your contact information. You
      promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about
      yourself. You may not select as your Arden User ID a name that you do not have the right to
      use, or another person&apos;s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not
      transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You represent and
      warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not,
      you&apos;ve received your parent&apos;s or guardian&apos;s permission to use the Services and
      have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).
      <br />
      <br />
      You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or
      for the benefit of any third party. You will comply with all laws that apply to you, your use
      of the Services, and your actions and omissions that relate to the Services (for example,
      Sellers must comply with all laws that relate to the Digital Assets (as defined below)). If
      your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren&apos;t authorized to
      use the Services. We can&apos;t and won&apos;t be responsible for your using the Services in a
      way that breaks the law. You will not share your Arden User ID, account or password with
      anyone, and you must protect the security of your Arden User ID, account, password and any
      other access tools or credentials. You&apos;re responsible for any activity associated with
      your Arden User ID and account.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Connecting Sellers and Purchasers for Sales of Digital Assets</strong>
      <br />
      Arden may, from time to time, connect persons who are selling non-fungible tokens or other
      digital assets implemented on a blockchain (such persons, “Sellers” and such assets, “Digital
      Assets”) and persons looking to acquire those Digital Assets (“Purchasers”). When we use the
      word “you” in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether he or she is a Seller
      or Purchaser, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of
      user. <br />
      Arden is only responsible for connecting Sellers and Purchasers, and can&apos;t and won&apos;t
      be responsible for making sure that Digital Assets match the description provided by the
      Seller or otherwise meet any Purchaser criteria. We don&apos;t control the actions of any
      Purchaser or Seller, and Sellers aren&apos;t our employees.
      <br />
      All purchases and sales are executed at your own risk. We do not have the ability to freeze,
      cancel or otherwise modify any transaction that you execute through our Services. We do not
      store, send, or receive Digital Assets. Any transfer that occurs in relation to any Digital
      Asset occurs on the relevant blockchain network, and we cannot guarantee that any transaction
      will be completed in the manner intended. We do not develop or control the smart contracts
      that govern the transfer of Digital Assets.
      <br />
      Transactions for Digital Assets may require the payment of “gas” or other transaction fees.
      You are responsible for ensuring that you have adequate funds in your wallet to complete
      transactions. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions
      due to insufficient funds.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>
        Arden does not provide a wallet to store or access Digital Assets. Currently, the Services
        integrate with third-party custodial wallets offered by Halliday (the “Halliday Wallet”).
        Your use of the Halliday Wallet is subject to Halliday&apos;s terms of service and privacy
        policy. We make no representations or warranties about the Halliday Wallet and are not
        responsible for the acts or omissions of Halliday.{' '}
      </strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>
        In addition, Arden does not directly offer Digital Assets. We are not a broker, financial
        institution or creditor. We facilitate transactions between Purchasers and Seller but are
        not a party to any purchase or sale agreement between Users. You hereby acknowledge that
        Arden does not supervise, direct, control or monitor the Digital Assets and expressly
        disclaims any responsibility and liability for the Digital Assets, including but not limited
        to any warranty or condition of quality or fitness for a particular purpose, or compliance
        with any law, regulation, or code. Sellers are solely responsible for determining and
        establishing the price of a Digital Asset, inclusive of any applicable tax.{' '}
      </strong>
      <br />
      Although the terms of sale for a Digital Asset are displayed on the Services, all such terms
      are determined by the Purchasers and Sellers and the sale and purchase of Digital Assets are
      subject to such (e.g., with respect to the use of the artwork associated with the Digital
      Asset) (“Purchase Terms”), including, but not limited to, the price to be paid for such
      Digital Asset. Arden is not a party to any such Purchase Terms, which are solely between the
      Purchaser and the Seller.
      <br />
      Purchasers and Sellers must not enter into separate agreements outside of Arden relating to
      Digital Assets listed on our Services (“Outside Agreements”). If you do enter into any Outside
      Agreement we may terminate your Arden account, and you acknowledge that Arden is not a party
      to and isn&apos;t responsible for enforcing any Outside Agreement.
      <br />
      <strong>
        YOU SHOULD be aware that all DIGITAL ASSET investments involve risks, including the risk of
        loss of some or all DIGITAL assets. Losses are not insured, and YOU assume responsibility
        for all losses. YOU are advised to exercise caution, conduct research, and not to transact
        more than YOU can afford to lose.

      <br />
      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>What about Poetry in Motion?</p>
      Poetry in Motion (“PiM”) is a Service that enables users to craft, experiment and share their
      creativity by purchasing word packs and creating poems (“Poems”) using the words in those word
      packs. You will not be able to create a Poem unless you have all of the words contained in
      such Poem in your inventory. Once you have created a Poem, if you click “combine and save,”
      the Poem will be minted as a non-fungible token (“NFT”) on the Sui blockchain. Alternatively,
      you can delete a Poem and the words contained in such Poem will be returned to your inventory
      for use with other Poems.
      <br />
      To use PiM, you will need a web3-enabled wallet that is able to support the native Sui token
      and Sui non-fungible tokens. All Poems minted to the Sui blockchain are outside of our control
      and are subject to many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. We do not own or
      control the Sui blockchain.
      <br />
      You own both the NFT representing the Poem and the underlying intellectual property rights in
      any Poem that you create through PiM. Any Poem displayed through PiM or our other Services
      will constitute a User Submission in accordance with these Terms and subject to the licenses
      granted herein.
      <br />
      You are solely responsible for the Poems that you create. You represent and warrant that such
      Poems are solely your original work and do not contain material subject to copyright,
      trademark, publicity rights or other intellectual property rights unless you have the
      necessary permission or are otherwise legally entitled to use such intellectual property
      rights.
      <br />
      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>Are there restrictions in how I can use the Services?</p>

      <br />A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or
      access the Services.
      <br />
      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>What are my rights in the Services?</p>
      The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but
      not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User
      Submissions (as defined below) and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are
      protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all
      copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you
      access through the Services, and you won&apos;t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate,
      publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell,

      Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for any purpose other

      <br />
      <strong>User Submissions </strong>
      <br />
      Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your
      “User Submission”. This includes any images or other copyrightable work associated with
      Digital Assets that you may list in the Services. Some User Submissions may be viewable by
      other users. You are solely responsible for all User Submissions you contribute to the
      Services. You represent that all User Submissions submitted by you are accurate, complete,
      up-to-date, and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. When you
      purchase a Digital Asset, you will own it and have all rights to further sell, display or give
      away the Digital Asset for as long as you own it. The intellectual property rights granted to
      a Purchaser of a Digital Asset will be as dictated by the Purchase Terms for such Digital
      Asset. You agree that you will not post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through
      the Services any User Submissions that: (i) infringe any third party`&apos;`s copyrights or
      other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.); (ii) contain sexually explicit content
      or pornography; (iii) contain hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incite hatred
      against any individual or group; (iv) exploit minors; (v) depict unlawful acts or extreme
      violence; (vi) depict animal cruelty or extreme violence towards animals; (vii) promote
      fraudulent schemes, multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, get rich quick schemes, online gaming
      and gambling, cash gifting, work from home businesses, or any other dubious money-making
      ventures; or (viii) that violate any law.
      <br />
      <strong>Licenses</strong>
      <br />
      In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to view
      them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions (see below for
      more information). Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our{' '}

        {' '}
        Privacy Policy{' '}
      </Link>{' '}
      to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable
      information. For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Arden a license to translate, modify
      (for technical purposes, for example, making sure your content is viewable on a mobile device
      as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions,
      in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is
      a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected. If you share a User
      Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that is viewable by other users, or if
      you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements,
      enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a
      “Public User Submission”), then you grant Arden the license above, as well as a license to
      display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that
      Public User Submission accessible to Arden users. You agree that the licenses you grant are
      royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you
      delist any Digital Asset, we will stop displaying the relevant User Submissions associated
      with that Digital Asset, but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to
      completely delete that content from Arden`&apos;`s records, and that your User Submissions may
      remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.
      Finally, you understand and agree that Arden, in performing the required technical steps to
      provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User
      Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of
      connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the
      rights to do so.

      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>Assumption of Risk</p>
      You accept and acknowledge:
      <br />
      (a) The value of a Digital Asset is subjective. Prices of Digital Assets are subject to
      volatility. You acknowledge that you fully understand this subjectivity and volatility and
      that you may lose money.
      <br />
      (b) You understand that you are responsible for any fees related to use of the Services,
      including for actions you take on the blockchain, regardless of whether a successful
      transaction occurs, and that such fees are final and irreversible.
      <br />
      (c) The regulatory regime governing Digital Assets and other blockchain or crypto-based items
      is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development
      of the Services and the utility of Digital Assets.
      <br />
      (d) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your transactions
      and to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate
      tax authorities. Arden is not responsible for determining, withholding, collecting, reporting,
      or remitting any taxes that apply to your Digital Assets or the sale/purchase of your Digital
      Assets.
      <br />
      (e) There are risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third
      parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the risk of
      purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items that are vulnerable to metadata decay,
      items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable. You represent
      and warrant that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell,
      obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any Digital Assets.
      <br />
      (f) We do not have ownership or control of the smart contracts deployed by third parties, and
      are not responsible and make no guarantees regarding their operation and functionality.
      <br />
      (g) We do not control the public blockchains that you are interacting with and we do not
      control certain smart contracts and protocols that may be integral to your ability to complete
      transactions on these public blockchains. Additionally, blockchain transactions are
      irreversible and Arden has no ability to reverse any transactions on the blockchain.

      (h) There are risks associated with using Internet and blockchain based products, including,
      but not limited to, the risk associated with hardware, software, and Internet connections, the
      risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
      unauthorized access to your third-party wallet. You accept and acknowledge that Arden will not
      be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you

      <br />
      If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any
      third party, you agree that Arden is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that
      you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Arden, its directors, officers,
      employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature,
      known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any
      way related to such disputes and/or our Services. You shall and hereby do waive California
      Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A
      general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know
      or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if
      known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
      released party.”

      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>Will Arden ever change the Services?</p>
      We&apos;re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend
      or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on
      certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We&apos;ll try to give
      you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but
      this isn&apos;t always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services
      at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed
      that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.
      <br />
      <br />
      <p className='font-light text-2xl'>Do the Services cost anything?</p>
      While the Services do not cost anything, Arden may receive fees if you choose to purchase or
      sell a Digital Asset through the Services. Arden does not set, collect, or determine other
      applicable costs, fees, or expenses associated with buying and selling a Digital Asset,
      including any creator earnings, gas, or transaction fees. These costs, fees, and expenses are
      paid directly to the Seller, creator, payment processor, blockchain validator, or other third
      party, as applicable. Because these costs, fees, and expenses are not collected by Arden, we
      cannot refund them. To enable purchases and sales through the Services, we use a third-party
      payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to
      your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”). The processing of payments will be
      subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to
      these Terms. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. You can access
      Stripe&apos;s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy
      Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. We are not responsible for any error by, or other
      acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By making a purchase through the Services, you
      agree to pay, through the Payment Processor, all charges applicable to such purchase in
      accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment
      Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make
      payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or
      mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received
      payment.

      , as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us
      after you have stopped using our Services. Arden is also free to terminate (or suspend access
      to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your
      breach of these Terms. Arden has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any
      of the restrictions set forth in these Terms; for example, a Purchaser who believes that a
      Seller may be in breach of these Terms is not able to enforce these Terms against that Seller.
      Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so
      keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. If you have deleted your
      account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@arden.cc – we will try to help, but
      unfortunately, we can&apos;t promise that we can recover or restore anything. Provisions that,
      by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way
      of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us
      or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or
      intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without
      limitation the arbitration agreement.

      liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including
      attorneys&apos; fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your
      use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b)
      your violation of these Terms. Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these
      Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by
      operation of law or otherwise) without Arden`&apos;`s prior written consent. We may transfer,
      assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent. Choice of Law.
      These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act,
      applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts of
      laws provisions thereof. Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION
      AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with
      Arden and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Arden. Both you and Arden
      acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the
      subject matter of these Terms, Arden`&apos;`s officers, directors, employees and independent
      contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your
      acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted
      the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.
      <br />
      <br />
      (a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their
      best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or
      relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which
      shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not
      resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Harris County,
      Texas. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS
      Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial
      arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial
      contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS
      arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator
      may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      <br />
      (b) Costs of Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Arden will
      pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Arden
      will not seek its attorneys&apos; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator
      determines that your claim is frivolous.
      <br />
      (c) Small Claims Court; Infringement. Either you or Arden may assert claims, if they qualify,
      in small claims court in Harris County, Texas or any United States county where you live or
      work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party
      shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any
      court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
      misappropriation or violation of a party`&apos;`s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
      patents or other intellectual property rights.
      <br />
      (d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND ARDEN WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO
      COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Arden are instead choosing to have
      claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more
      limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to
      very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Arden over whether to vacate
      or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND ARDEN WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect
      instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      <br />
      (e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS
      ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A
      CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
      JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of
      class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Arden is
      entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set
      forth in (g) below.
      <br />
      (f) Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending
      written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 4200 Montrose Blvd Suite
      100, Houston, Texas 77006 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.
      You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone
      number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of
      these Terms&apos; arbitration agreement.
      <br />
      (g) Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where
      the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Arden to litigate any dispute
      arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing
      arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Arden agree that any
      judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal
      courts located in, respectively, Harris County, Texas, or the federal district in which that
      county falls.
      <br />
      (h) Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf
      of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding
      language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration
      agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Arden.
      <br />
      <br />
      Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all
      taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection
      with the Services, provided that the Arden may, in its sole discretion, do any of the
      foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to
      exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights
      hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
      provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms
      shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Arden agree that
      these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you
      and Arden, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements,
      communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You
      hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of
      Arden, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Arden in any respect whatsoever.
      Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you
      and Arden agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
